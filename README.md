# 🚀 LLM_FINE-Tuning


Welcome to this repository, where we explore **LLaMA2 fine-tuning with LoRA** and **BERT-based sentiment analysis**! This project demonstrates how different transformer models (GPT-based vs. BERT-based) can be leveraged for various NLP tasks, showcasing fine-tuning techniques, quantization, and performance observations.

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This repository contains two key Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Knowledge Augmentation using LLaMA2** ([`Knowledge_augumentation(LLamaV2).ipynb`](./Knowledge_augumentation(LLamaV2).ipynb))
   - Fine-tunes **LLaMA2** using **LoRA** for efficient adaptation.
   - Implements **4-bit quantization** to optimize memory usage.
   - Uses a **medical terms dataset** for knowledge augmentation.
   - Evaluates text generation performance on domain-specific queries.

2. **Movie Sentiment Analysis with BERT** ([`Movie_sentiment_Analysis(Bert).ipynb`](./Movie_sentiment_Analysis(Bert).ipynb))
   - Fine-tunes **BERT** for sentiment classification on a movie reviews dataset.
   - Applies tokenization, preprocessing, and classification fine-tuning.
   - Compares performance with traditional NLP models.
   - Analyzes sentiment predictions to understand model behavior.

## 🔍 **Key Differences: GPT vs. BERT**

| Feature          | GPT (LLaMA2) | BERT |
|-----------------|-------------|------|
| **Architecture** | Auto-regressive (Generative) | Auto-encoding (Bidirectional) |
| **Task**        | Text Generation | Text Classification |
| **Fine-tuning** | LoRA + Quantization | Standard BERT fine-tuning |
| **Efficiency**  | Optimized for long text generation | Optimized for understanding context |
| **Use Case**    | Knowledge augmentation, dialogue systems | Sentiment analysis, NLP tasks |

## 📊 **Key Observations**

🔹 **LLaMA2 (GPT-style) excels** in generating domain-specific text but requires **fine-tuning for accuracy** in specialized fields.  
🔹 **LoRA + 4-bit Quantization** significantly reduces the memory footprint while maintaining good performance.  
🔹 **BERT performs well in classification tasks**, leveraging bidirectional context understanding.  
🔹 **GPT models (like LLaMA2) require more computational resources** compared to BERT when used for fine-tuning.
